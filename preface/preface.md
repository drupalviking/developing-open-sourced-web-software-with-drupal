# Preface

Welcome to the latest edition of Developing Open Sourced Web Software with Drupal. This book is intended to be a teaching material for courses in universities, colleges and other educational institutes, as well as for more narrow scopes like Drupal in a Day sessions, held at Drupal Cons and Drupal Camps. A basic knowledge of Computer Science is required.

This book will cover the basics of what open sorced software is and why we would rather write our code as open source rather than proprietary. And after that, we will deep dive into developing a Drupal website, beginning with basic site building but ending with module development.

The book is also open source, meaning that you can freely download, reuse, modify and redistribute any component of it as you like under the terms of the GPL license. Why write a book on open source if we don't do it open-sourcingly!
