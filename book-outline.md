# Book outline

This document is supposed to keep the basic outline of the chapters and how we would like to organise them. Since the book has not been finalized, organising the chapters with numbers is not nesseccary, a good, descriptive name is enough.

## Preface
The preface of the book

## History of Drupal
It would be great to integrate into this book a brief history of Drupal, since that's not always covered. 

* Where did it start
* Who is the first author
* How did the project evolve?
* The Migration from D7 to D8-D9-D10-D11-D12, how that became to be.
* The next big thing: Drupal CMS. 

## What is Open Source
In this chapter we cover all the basics about open source software, history, licenses etc. Why should we choose open source rather that proprietary software?

## Development tools
This chapter covers all the different development tools you need for Drupal install and development. Everything from system platforms like Docker and DDEv, IDE's, versioning control etc.

## Installing Drupal
This chapter should cover both installation of Drupal Core and Drupal CMS (or should we have it as a seperate chapters?). Let's keep this chapter simple, just to cover each installation.

## Where do I begin?
* What is a CMS?
* Overview of the layout of a Drupal Site
* Navigating the menu tree
* Updating basic information
* Building blocks: Content types, menus, blocks, useres, themes and modules.

## Everything is an entity: How Drupal structures it's data
* More detailed overview of content types
    * How to create new Content type
    * How to add fields to Content types
    * How to alter the form view when editing content types
    * How to alter how the content displays as a page
* Taxonomies. The difference between them and content types and their similarities.

Also explain how the entity system works in Drupal, how everything is Entity and implements the Entity Interface, therefor we can get all kinds of things "magically".

## Customising our site
* Users
    * Roles - Default roles and User generated roles
    * Permissions
